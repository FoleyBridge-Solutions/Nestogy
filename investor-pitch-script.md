# Nestogy Investor Pitch Video Script

Another MSP just went under. [sighs] They had great technicians, solid clients, but bled out from operational chaos. Seven different tools. Manual invoicing. Forty percent margins crushed to fifteen.

ConnectWise charges twenty thousand just to get started. [frustrated] SuperOps' AI writes nice emails while revenue leaks everywhere. HaloPSA? Built for enterprises, not the thirty-thousand MSPs fighting to survive.

The MSP market hits three hundred billion next year. [thoughtful] Yet most providers operate like it's 2005. Tool sprawl. Manual processes. Zero automation where it counts.

Enter Nestogy - built by MSPs who lived this nightmare.

One platform. No URL parameters. No page reloads. [surprised] Our session-based architecture lets entire teams work simultaneously without conflicts. ConnectWise still passes client IDs in URLs like it's 1999.

Watch this. [excited] Technician opens ticket. Timer starts automatically. Detects after-hours rates. Work completes. Time converts to invoice. Payment processes. Books reconcile. Zero human touch.

Ten thousand invoices processed in thirty minutes. [impressed] Not theoretically. Actually. Running in production today.

Here's what competitors can't copy. Hundred seventy-six database migrations encoding five years of MSP workflow refinement. Fifteen independent business domains that can be white-labeled separately. Programmable contracts with dynamic pricing.

Our early adopters report thirty percent margin improvement in ninety days. [confident] One client added six hundred thousand in telecommunications revenue using our compliance engine.

The opportunity? Forty thousand MSPs globally. Average contract value seventy-two thousand annually. [calculating] Two percent market share equals half billion valuation.

We're raising Series A to capture this market before competitors wake up. [determined]
