# Complete Database Seeding Guide for Nestogy ERP

**Created:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a complete roadmap for implementing comprehensive database seeding for the Nestogy ERP system. The analysis identified **61 missing seeders** and created a dependency-based seeding order across **21 levels** covering **110 total seeders**.

## Current Status

### What We Have
- **Total Models**: 222
- **Total Factories**: 115 available
- **Dev Seeders on Disk**: 113 files
- **Dev Seeders Currently Called**: ~52

### The Gap
- **Missing from DevDatabaseSeeder**: **61 seeders**
- **Stub-Only Implementations**: ~40 seeders (exist but don't seed data)
- **Completely Missing**: ~18 seeders (no file exists yet)

---

## Analysis Findings

### 1. Missing High-Priority Domains

#### Financial Domain (13 seeders missing)
The financial domain is incomplete, missing critical functionality:
- No credit notes or refund processing
- No revenue metrics (MRR/ARR tracking)
- No cash flow projections
- No financial reports
- No payment plans
- No invoice items seeding
- No quote workflow (approvals, versions, templates)

**Impact**: Cannot test or demo complete financial lifecycle

#### Collections Domain (4 seeders missing)
Entire collections/dunning system not seeded:
- No dunning campaigns
- No dunning sequences or actions
- No collection notes

**Impact**: Cannot test or demo collections process

#### Tax System (9 seeders missing)
Complete tax engine not populated:
- No tax profiles or jurisdictions
- No tax calculations
- No tax exemptions
- No VoIP or service tax rates
- No tax API integration testing

**Impact**: Cannot test tax compliance features

#### Product/Usage Domain (7 seeders missing)
Usage-based billing not seeded:
- No services (separate from products)
- No usage pools or buckets
- No usage tiers or records
- No usage alerts
- No product bundles
- No pricing rules

**Impact**: Cannot test SaaS/usage-based billing features

#### HR Domain (4 seeders completely missing)
**NO HR data is being seeded at all**:
- Need to create: `ShiftSeeder`
- Need to create: `EmployeeScheduleSeeder`
- Need to create: `EmployeeTimeEntrySeeder`
- Pay periods exist but no data

**Impact**: Cannot test HR/payroll features

### 2. Dependency Issues

The current DevDatabaseSeeder does not respect proper dependency order:
- Tax seeders would fail (no products exist yet when tax data is needed)
- Usage tracking can't work (no services defined)
- Collections can't work (need invoices first)
- HR time entries can't work (need pay periods and shifts)

### 3. Stub Implementations

Many seeders exist but are empty stubs:
```php
public function run(): void
{
    $this->command->info("Creating Model records...");
    // NO ACTUAL FACTORY CALLS
    $this->command->info("‚úì Model seeded");
}
```

**Examples**:
- `CashFlowProjectionSeeder`
- `DunningCampaignSeeder`
- `TaxProfileSeeder`
- `UsagePoolSeeder`
- And 36 more...

## The Solution: 21-Level Dependency-Based Seeding

### Architecture Principles

1. **Dependency Respect**: Seed parent records before children
2. **Multi-Tenancy First**: Company ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Everything else
3. **Client-Centric**: Clients are hub connecting all domains
4. **Financial Flow**: Quotes ‚Üí Invoices ‚Üí Taxes ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Credits
5. **Realistic Volumes**: Mid-market MSP (10-75 employees, 30-80 clients)

### Seeding Levels Overview

| Level | Category | Count | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Core Configuration | 9 | None |
| 1 | Company & Infrastructure | 7 | Level 0 |
| 2 | Users & Accounts | 6 | Level 1 |
| 3 | Shifts & Schedules | 2 | Level 2 |
| 4 | Clients, Vendors & SLA | 3 | Level 1 |
| 5 | Client Details | 8 | Level 4 |
| 6 | Products & Services | 6 | Level 1 |
| 7 | Usage Tracking | 5 | Level 6 |
| 8 | Tax Configuration | 6 | Levels 1, 4, 6 |
| 9 | Contracts & Assets | 6 | Levels 4, 5 |
| 10 | Projects & Tickets | 5 | Levels 2, 4 |
| 11 | Time Tracking | 3 | Levels 1, 3, 10 |
| 12 | Quotes | 4 | Level 4 |
| 13 | Invoices | 5 | Levels 4, 10, 11 |
| 14 | Tax Calculations | 2 | Levels 8, 13 |
| 15 | Payments & Credits | 6 | Levels 2, 4, 13 |
| 16 | Credit Notes & Refunds | 5 | Levels 4, 15 |
| 17 | Collections & Dunning | 4 | Levels 4, 13 |
| 18 | Financial Reports | 4 | Levels 13, 15 |
| 19 | Analytics & Advanced | 5 | Multiple |
| 20 | Documents & Notifications | 6 | Levels 1-4 |

4. ‚úÖ Load testing and performance optimization
5. ‚úÖ Training environments
6. ‚úÖ QA/staging environments

---

## Critical Dependencies Explained

### 1. Multi-Tenancy (company_id)
Almost every table requires `company_id`. **Company must be seeded first.**

### 2. Client-Centric Architecture
Client connects:
- Financial (invoices, payments, quotes)
- Operations (tickets, projects, contracts)
- Assets (equipment, locations)
- Collections (dunning campaigns)

**Clients must exist before most operational data.**

### 3. Financial Flow
```
Quote ‚Üí Invoice ‚Üí Tax Calculation ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Credit Note ‚Üí Refund
  ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                          
Approval           Exemptions
Version            Jurisdictions
```

**Must follow this order or foreign keys will fail.**

### 4. HR Time Tracking
```
PayPeriod ‚Üí Shift ‚Üí EmployeeSchedule ‚Üí EmployeeTimeEntry
```

**Can't track time without periods and shifts defined.**

### 5. Collections Workflow
```
Invoice (overdue) ‚Üí DunningCampaign ‚Üí DunningSequence ‚Üí DunningAction ‚Üí CollectionNote
```

**Need unpaid invoices before collections makes sense.**

## How to Use This Guide

### For Developers
1. Read `DATABASE_SEEDING_DEPENDENCY_DIAGRAM.md` to understand the order
2. Check `MODEL_RELATIONSHIPS_ANALYSIS.md` for specific model relationships
3. Implement seeders following the 21-level structure
4. Test each level independently before proceeding

### For QA/Testing
1. Use `DevDatabaseSeeder` for test data generation
2. Expect ~36,000 records with 2 years of history
3. All relationships will be valid (no orphaned records)
4. Data will be realistic (using Faker)

### For Documentation
1. All diagrams are in Mermaid format (GitHub-compatible)
2. Can be rendered in GitLab, VS Code, or Mermaid Live
3. Update diagrams when adding new models
