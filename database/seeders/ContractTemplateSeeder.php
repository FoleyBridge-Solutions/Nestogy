FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS:
In consideration for the Support Services, Client shall pay {{service_provider_short_name}} the recurring fees calculated based on the selected Service Tier and the quantity of Supported Infrastructure components, as set forth in Schedule B. Client shall elect either {{billing_frequency}} billing (specified in Schedule A). Election of Quarterly payment entitles Client to a five percent (5%) discount on the fees specified in Schedule B for such quarter.

Any amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, commencing fifteen (15) days after the payment due date, until paid in full.

{{service_provider_short_name}} reserves the right to review and adjust the fees set forth in Schedule B effective upon the annual anniversary of the Effective Date. Fees may also be adjusted upon mutual written agreement following material changes to the Supported Infrastructure per {{services_section_ref}}.1.

Any services requested by Client that fall outside the defined scope of Support Services (\"Out-of-Scope Services\") may be provided by {{service_provider_short_name}} subject to a separate written agreement (e.g., Statement of Work) at {{service_provider_short_name}}'s then-current standard rates.

Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party of a material breach of any provision of this Agreement, provided such breach remains uncured at the expiration of said notice period.

Notwithstanding {{financial_section_ref}}.c, {{service_provider_short_name}} may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice should Client fail to pay any amount when due. (This termination right is in addition to the right of suspension under {{obligations_section_ref}}.d).

Either Party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon written notice if the other Party becomes insolvent, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files a voluntary petition of bankruptcy, suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets, or becomes subject to any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law.

Upon termination or expiration hereof for any reason, Client shall immediately pay all outstanding fees accrued up to the effective date of termination. {{service_provider_short_name}} shall reasonably cooperate in transition activities, potentially subject to agreed transition fees. {{legal_section_ref}}, {{confidentiality_section_ref}}, {{admin_section_ref}}, and other provisions which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination or expiration.

Neither Party shall have any authority to contract for or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever.

FORCE MAJEURE:
Neither Party shall be liable or responsible to the other Party, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts beyond the affected Party's reasonable control, including, without limitation: acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, or explosion; war, invasion, hostilities, terrorist threats or acts, riot, or other civil unrest; actions, embargoes, or blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement; action by any governmental authority; national or regional emergency; strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns, or other industrial disturbances; or shortage of adequate power or transportation facilities (each a \"Force Majeure Event\"). The affected Party shall give prompt notice to the other Party, stating the period of time the occurrence is expected to continue, and shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and minimize its effects.

ASSIGNMENT:
Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {{service_provider_short_name}} may assign this Agreement in its entirety, without consent of the Client, to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void.

SEVERABILITY:
If any term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible.

COUNTERPARTS:
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email, or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Recurring Support Services Agreement to be executed by their respective duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date first referenced above (or the date of last signature below, if later).
