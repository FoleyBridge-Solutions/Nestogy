## Tips & Tricks

1. **Use Natural Language**: Instead of memorizing commands, just type what you want to do
   - "find overdue invoices for acme corp"
   - "show me urgent tickets"
   - "create quote for current client"

2. **Context Awareness**: The system remembers your selected client and shows relevant options
   - When a client is selected, "create invoice" automatically associates it
   - Search results prioritize the selected client's data

3. **Entity-Specific Searches**: Use entity prefixes for targeted searching
   - `quote:` - Search only quotes
   - `asset:` - Search only assets
   - `project:` - Search only projects
   - `contract:` - Search only contracts

4. **Smart Filtering**: Commands understand context
   - "show pending" - Shows pending items across all types
   - "show overdue" - Shows overdue invoices, projects, tickets
   - "show my" - Shows items assigned to you

5. **Comprehensive Search**: One search queries ALL entities
   - Type "server" to find:
     - Tickets mentioning server
     - Assets named server
     - IT Documentation about servers
     - Knowledge articles about servers

6. **Quick Creation**: Create anything from anywhere
   - No need to navigate to specific pages
   - Context is preserved (selected client, current view)

## Troubleshooting

### Command Palette Not Opening?
- Ensure you're not in a text input field
- Try the alternative shortcut (`/`)
- Click the "Search" button in the navigation bar (shows Ctrl+/)
- Refresh the page if shortcuts aren't working

### Search Not Working?
- Check your internet connection

### Search Results Empty?
- Try broader search terms
- Check if you have the right client selected
- Ensure the entity type exists in your system
- Some models might not be deployed yet
