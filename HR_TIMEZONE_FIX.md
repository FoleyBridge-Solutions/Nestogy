# ✅ HR Time Tracking - Timezone Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Display Showing Wrong Time (4:00 PM instead of 11:00 AM)**
**Root Cause:** Times were stored correctly in UTC but displayed without timezone conversion.
- Database stores: 16:00 UTC
- Company timezone: America/New_York (EDT = UTC-4)
- Correct display: 12:00 PM EDT
- User's local time: 11:00 AM CDT (Chicago)

**Fix:** Added timezone conversion to all timestamp displays:
```php
$activeEntry->clock_in->timezone(auth()->user()->company->timezone)->format('g:i A')
```

### 2. **Negative Timer (-1:-2)**
**Root Cause:** The `roundTime()` function had a critical bug that caused times to be rounded into the FUTURE.

**The Bug:**
```php
// OLD CODE - BROKEN
$minutes = $time->minute;  // 53
$roundedMinutes = round($minutes / $roundToMinutes) * $roundToMinutes;  // round(53/15) = 4, 4*15 = 60
return $time->copy()->minute($roundedMinutes);  // Setting minute to 60 rolls to next hour!
```

When clock-in happened at 15:53 with 15-minute rounding:
- 53 / 15 = 3.53
- round(3.53) = 4
- 4 * 15 = **60 minutes** → rolls to 16:00 (next hour!)
- Result: Clock-in time in the future → negative elapsed time

**Fix:** Proper time rounding that handles hour boundaries:
```php
// NEW CODE - CORRECT
$totalMinutes = $time->hour * 60 + $time->minute;  // 15*60 + 53 = 953
$roundedTotalMinutes = round($totalMinutes / $roundToMinutes) * $roundToMinutes;  // round(953/15) = 64, 64*15 = 960
return $time->copy()->startOfDay()->addMinutes($roundedTotalMinutes);  // 960 min = 16:00
```

## Files Changed

1. **resources/views/livewire/hr/time-clock.blade.php**
   - Added timezone conversion to "Started at" time
   - Added timezone conversion to "Ready to Clock In" current time
   - Added timezone conversion to recent entries list

2. **app/Domains/HR/Services/TimeClockService.php**
   - Fixed `roundTime()` method to properly handle hour boundaries
   - Now calculates total minutes from midnight before rounding

## Testing

The existing active entry with clock_in at 16:00 UTC will now display correctly:
- For America/New_York users: 12:00 PM
- For America/Chicago users: 11:00 AM (if they set their timezone)

New clock-ins will be stored at the correct time (not rounded into the future).

## Next Steps for User

If times still don't match user's local time, check:
```php
// Check company timezone setting
$company = auth()->user()->company;
echo $company->setting->timezone;  // Should be user's timezone

// Update if needed
$company->setting->update(['timezone' => 'America/Chicago']);
```

All times will automatically convert to the company's configured timezone!
