## 🔄 Architecture Changes

### Before (Old System)
```
Payment
  ├─ invoice_id (FK) → Single Invoice
  └─ amount

Problem: 1 payment = 1 invoice only
         Overpayments lost
         No reallocation possible
```

### After (New System)
```
Payment
  ├─ amount
  ├─ applied_amount (calculated)
  ├─ available_amount (calculated)
  ├─ application_status (enum)
  └─ applications → PaymentApplication
                     ├─ invoice_id
                     ├─ amount
                     ├─ applied_at
                     ├─ applied_by
                     ├─ unapplied_at
                     └─ unapplied_by

ClientCredit (from overpayments)
  ├─ amount
  ├─ available_amount
  ├─ type (overpayment, promotional, etc.)
  └─ applications → CreditApplication
                     ├─ invoice_id
                     ├─ amount
                     └─ applied_at

Benefits: 
  ✅ 1 payment → MANY invoices
  ✅ Overpayments → client credits
  ✅ Full reallocation support
  ✅ Complete audit trail
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Quick Smoke Test
```bash
# 1. Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# 2. Create test data
php artisan tinker
>>> $client = Client::first();
>>> $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create(['client_id' => $client->id, 'amount' => 1000]);

# 3. Test payment with auto-apply
>>> $payment = Payment::factory()->create([
...   'client_id' => $client->id,
...   'amount' => 1200,
...   'auto_apply' => true
... ]);

# 4. Verify application
>>> $payment->applications; // Should show application to invoice
>>> $payment->getAvailableAmount(); // Should show $200 (overpayment)

# 5. Check credit created
>>> ClientCredit::where('client_id', $client->id)->first();
// Should exist with $200 amount
```

### UI Testing Checklist
```
□ Visit /financial/payments - see application status column
□ Click payment - see applications tab with unapply button
□ Visit /financial/invoices/{id} - see payment applications (not raw payments)
□ Visit /financial/credits - see credits index with filters
□ Create new credit - form works and saves
□ Apply credit to invoice - reduces credit available amount
□ Void credit - changes status and prevents further use
```

## 📖 User Guide (Quick Reference)

### For Accountants: How to Record a Payment

**Scenario 1: Payment for Specific Invoice**
1. Go to Financial → Payments → Create Payment
2. Select client and invoice
3. Enter payment amount
4. Uncheck "Auto-Apply Payment"
5. Submit → Payment applied to that invoice only

**Scenario 2: Payment for Multiple Invoices (Auto-Apply)**
1. Go to Financial → Payments → Create Payment  
2. Select client (don't select invoice)
3. Enter payment amount
4. Check "Auto-Apply Payment"
5. Submit → Payment automatically applied to oldest invoices
6. If overpayment → Credit created automatically

**Scenario 3: Manual Credit Creation**
1. Go to Financial → Client Credits → Create Credit
2. Select client and credit type (promotional, goodwill, etc.)
3. Enter amount and reason
4. Set expiry date (optional)
5. Submit → Credit available for future invoices

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Application status not updating
**Solution:**
```php
php artisan tinker
>>> $payment = Payment::find(123);
>>> $payment->recalculateApplicationAmounts();
```

### Issue: Invoice balance incorrect
**Solution:** Ensure invoice uses `getBalance()` not `getTotalPaid()`. Check invoice model.

### Issue: Credit not showing in list
**Check:**
- Credit status is 'active'
- Not expired (expiry_date > now)
- Not voided (voided_at is null)

### Issue: Unapply button doesn't work
**Check:**
- CSRF token present in form
- Route exists: `financial.payment-applications.destroy`
- User has permission to unapply

### Issue: Auto-apply not working
**Check:**
- `auto_apply` flag is true on payment
- Client has unpaid invoices
- PaymentService is being used (not direct model creation)
