## 🎯 Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
- **Clear Bounded Contexts**: Each domain has well-defined responsibilities
- **Aggregate Roots**: Core entities that maintain business invariants  
- **Domain Services**: Business logic encapsulated in dedicated services
- **Domain Events**: Event-driven communication between domains

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture  
- **Complete Data Isolation**: Tenant-scoped data access with global scopes
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions (Admin=3, Tech=2, Accountant=1)
- **Scalable Design**: Support for unlimited tenants with performance optimization
- **Security-First**: Multi-layered security with encryption and audit logging

### 3. Laravel Best Practices
- **Framework Conventions**: Following Laravel patterns and standards
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from controllers
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction where needed
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Laravel events for loose coupling

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Strategic Indexing**: Database optimization for performance
- **Caching Layers**: Model, query, and application-level caching
- **Background Processing**: Queue system for heavy operations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Architecture supports scaling across servers
