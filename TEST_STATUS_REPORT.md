# Test Status Report

**Generated:** 2025-01-06  
**Test Suite:** 1216 total tests  
**Success Rate:** ~94% (1143/1216 tests passing)

## Summary

✅ **Removed duplicate test file** (`tests/Unit/ClientControllerTest.php`)  
✅ **Added missing route** (`dashboard.stats`)  
✅ **Created custom test runner** (`run-tests.php`) to handle memory issues  
⚠️ **73 tests still need fixes** (31 errors + 42 failures)

---

## Test Runner Solution

Created `/opt/nestogy/run-tests.php` - a custom test runner that:
- Runs each test file in its own process to prevent memory exhaustion
- Frees memory after each test file completes
- Supports optional code coverage generation
- Provides clear progress tracking and summary

### Usage:

```bash
# Run all tests without coverage
php run-tests.php

# Run all tests with coverage
php run-tests.php --coverage

# For CI/CD
php -d memory_limit=512M vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover=coverage.xml --no-coverage
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. **Migration Order Issues** (Affects multiple tests)

**Problem:** Migrations create foreign keys before referenced tables exist.

**Evidence:**
```
SQLSTATE[42P01]: Undefined table: 7 ERROR: relation "companies" does not exist
(in client_certificates migration trying to reference companies table)
```

**Solution Needed:**
- Review migration file order and dependencies
- Ensure base tables (companies, users) are created before child tables
- Consider consolidating migrations or fixing foreign key timing

---

### 2. **Missing/Incorrect Routes** (31 errors)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `dashboard.stats` route

**Still Need Fixing:**
- `clients.validate-batch` - Route exists in `api.php` but tests expect it in web routes

**Solution:**
```php
// Add to routes/web.php in clients group:
Route::post('validate-batch', [ClientController::class, 'validateBatch'])
    ->name('clients.validate-batch');
```

---

### 3. **Authorization/Permission Failures** (42 failures)

**Problem:** Tests receiving 403 Forbidden responses

**Evidence:**
```
Expected response status code [201] but received 403.
Tests: test_store_creates_client_successfully, test_update_modifies_client_successfully, etc.
```

**Root Cause:**
- Tests not properly setting up Bouncer permissions
- User not assigned required abilities

**Solution Needed:**
```php
// In test setup:
protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();
    
    // Assign admin role or specific abilities
    Bouncer::allow($this->user)->everything();
    // OR
    Bouncer::allow($this->user)->to('create', Client::class);
}
```

---

### 4. **Protected Method Access** (5 errors)

**Problem:** Tests trying to call `initializeController()` which is protected

**Tests Affected:**
- `test_controller_initializes_correctly`
- `test_controller_has_correct_service_class`
- `test_controller_has_correct_resource_name`
- `test_controller_has_correct_view_prefix`
- `test_controller_has_correct_eager_load_relations`

**Solution:**
Tests are already using Reflection API correctly. The issue is the method doesn't exist publicly - check BaseController implementation.

---

### 5. **Minor Content-Type Mismatch** (1 failure)

**Test:** `test_leads_import_template_returns_csv`  
**Issue:** Header is `text/csv; charset=UTF-8` but test expects `text/csv`

**Solution:**
```php
// In test, change:
->assertHeader('content-type', 'text/csv')
// To:
->assertHeader('content-type', 'text/csv; charset=UTF-8')
```

## Test Categories Breakdown

### ✅ Fully Passing (94%)
- Unit/Models/* (Most model tests)
- Unit/Controllers/DashboardControllerTest (Unit version)
- Unit/Controllers/TicketControllerTest  
- Feature tests for basic operations

### ⚠️ Need Attention (6%)

**Controllers (Unit):**
- ClientControllerTest: 5 initialization tests

**Controllers (Feature):**
- ClientControllerTest: 23 authorization/permission tests
- DashboardControllerTest: 16 missing route tests  
- 4 validation/batch tests

---

## Priority Fixes

### High Priority (Blocks many tests)
1. Fix migration ordering to resolve database errors
2. Setup Bouncer permissions in test base class
3. Add missing `clients.validate-batch` web route

### Medium Priority
4. Fix ClientController initialization tests
5. Add getData() method to DashboardController

### Low Priority  
6. Fix content-type assertion in CSV tests

---

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Fresh database migrate for tests
php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing

# Run specific test file
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Models/AccountTest.php

# Run with memory limit
php -d memory_limit=2G vendor/bin/phpunit

# Use custom runner
php run-tests.php

# Check routes
php artisan route:list | grep dashboard
php artisan route:list | grep validate-batch
```

---

## Files Modified

1. `phpunit.xml` - Added ParallelTestingExtension bootstrap
2. `routes/web.php` - Added `dashboard.stats` route  
3. `run-tests.php` - Created custom test runner
4. Deleted `tests/Unit/ClientControllerTest.php` (duplicate)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix migrations** - Ensure proper table creation order
2. **Setup test permissions** - Add Bouncer setup to TestCase base class
3. **Add missing routes** - Complete route definitions
4. **Run full suite** - Verify all 1216 tests pass
5. **Setup CI/CD** - Configure for CircleCI with custom runner

---

**Note:** The memory issue described in the original problem is real. PHPUnit does not de-allocate the application between test classes, causing memory exhaustion on large test suites. The custom test runner solves this by running each test file in isolation.
