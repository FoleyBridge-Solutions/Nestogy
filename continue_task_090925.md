# Continue Task - Nestogy Dev Environment Setup (09/09/25)

## Current Status
Working on fixing database seeders for Nestogy Laravel application in LXC container `nestogy-dev`.

## Environment Details
- **Container**: nestogy-dev (LXC)
- **Application Path**: /opt/nestogy
- **Laravel Version**: 12.27.0
- **PHP Version**: 8.4.12
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (database: nestogy, user: nestogy, password: nestogy_dev_pass)
- **Development Server**: Running on port 8000 (background process ID: 9de437)

## Completed Tasks
1. âœ… Fixed Wayland clipboard support for OpenCode
2. âœ… Installed PHP 8.4 with extensions
3. âœ… Cloned Nestogy repository to /opt/nestogy
4. âœ… Set up PostgreSQL database
5. âœ… Configured Redis caching
6. âœ… Installed Composer dependencies (including Flux Pro)
7. âœ… Ran database migrations (145 tables created)
8. âœ… Built frontend assets with npm
9. âœ… Started Laravel dev server (php artisan serve)
10. âœ… Fixed CompanySeeder enum values:
    - 'platform' â†’ 'root'
    - 'msp' â†’ 'subsidiary'
    - 'multiplier' â†’ 'multipliers'
11. âœ… Fixed password field length issue in SettingsSeeder:
    - Created migration to change smtp_password and imap_password to text type
    - Migration successfully applied

## Current Status - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE! ðŸŽ‰

### Successfully Fixed and Running Seeders:
1. âœ… **CompanySeeder** - Creates 5 companies 
2. âœ… **SettingsSeeder** - Fixed password field length issue (changed to text)
3. âœ… **RolesAndPermissionsSeeder** - Creates roles with Bouncer
4. âœ… **UserSeeder** - Creates 46 users across companies
5. âœ… **CategorySeeder** - FIXED! Now properly adds company_id to all categories (355 created)
6. âœ… **VendorSeeder** - FIXED! Now properly adds company_id (67 vendors created)
7. âœ… **SLASeeder** - Working, creates SLAs for each company

### Seeders That Need ClientSeeder First (Temporarily Disabled):
- AssetSeeder
- ContractSeeder  
- TicketSeeder
- ProjectSeeder (also has `project_number` vs `number` column issue)
- InvoiceSeeder
- PaymentSeeder

### Missing Seeders (Need to be Created):
- **ClientSeeder** - CRITICAL! Many other seeders depend on this
- LocationSeeder
- ContactSeeder  
- NetworkSeeder
- TaxSeeder

## How to Continue

### Next Priority: Create ClientSeeder
Most remaining seeders depend on clients existing. Need to create a ClientSeeder that:
1. Creates clients for each company (except Nestogy Platform)
2. Includes realistic MSP client data
3. Sets up proper relationships with companies

### After ClientSeeder is Created:
1. Re-enable and fix the dependent seeders in DevDatabaseSeeder
2. Fix ProjectSeeder's `project_number` â†’ `number` column issue
3. Run full seeder suite to populate all test data

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Access container
lxc exec nestogy-dev -- bash

# Run seeders (from host)
lxc exec nestogy-dev -- bash -c "cd /opt/nestogy && php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --seeder=Database\\Seeders\\Dev\\DevDatabaseSeeder"

# Check database content
lxc exec nestogy-dev -- bash -c "cd /opt/nestogy && php artisan tinker"
>>> App\Models\Company::count()
>>> App\Models\User::count()
>>> App\Models\Client::count()
```

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT** create migrations to change schema unless absolutely necessary
- **DO NOT** create test data directly - fix the seeders
- The user strongly prefers fixing seeders over workarounds
- Database was freshly migrated with `php artisan migrate:fresh` before the last seeder run

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Access container
lxc exec nestogy-dev -- bash

# Run seeders
cd /opt/nestogy
php artisan db:seed --class=Database\\Seeders\\Dev\\DevDatabaseSeeder

# Check server status (running in background)
lxc exec nestogy-dev -- ps aux | grep artisan

# View seeder files
ls -la /opt/nestogy/database/seeders/Dev/
```

## Background Process
Laravel development server is running:
- Command: `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000`
- Process ID: 9de437
- Access URL: http://[container-ip]:8000

## User Preferences
- Strongly prefers fixing code properly over workarounds
- Gets upset when creating unnecessary migrations or test data
- Wants development seeders to work correctly for team use
