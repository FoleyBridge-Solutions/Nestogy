## Navigation System

Nestogy offers multiple ways to navigate efficiently:

### Sidebar Navigation

The left sidebar provides access to all major modules. Click any menu item to access that feature. The sidebar collapses on mobile devices and can be toggled with the menu button.

### Command Palette (⌘K)

The fastest way to navigate Nestogy. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette and search for:

- Features and pages

### Client Switcher

The client switcher in the top navigation lets you quickly switch between client contexts. When a client is selected, all tickets, invoices, and assets are filtered to that client.

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumb navigation appears at the top of most pages, showing your current location and allowing you to quickly navigate back to parent pages.
