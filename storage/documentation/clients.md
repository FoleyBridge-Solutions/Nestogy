# Client Management

Client management is at the heart of Nestogy. Learn how to add clients, manage contacts, track locations, and maintain detailed communication logs for each customer.

## Adding a New Client

To create a new client in Nestogy:

1. Click **Clients** in the sidebar navigation
2. Click the **Create Client** button in the top right
3. Fill in the client information form

## Client Dashboard

Each client has a dedicated dashboard showing:

> **Warning: Bulk Delete**: Deleting clients is permanent and will remove all associated tickets, invoices, and time entries. Consider marking them as "Inactive" instead.
