## ContractGenerationService - ATTEMPTED ⚠️

### Initial Test File Created
- **File**: `app/Domains/Contract/Services/ContractGenerationService.php`  
- **Test File**: `tests/Unit/Services/ContractGenerationServiceTest.php`
- **Method Coverage**: 1.75% (1/57 methods)
- **Line Coverage**: 7.30% (58/794 lines)
- **Test Methods Created**: 17
- **Tests Passing**: 2/17

### Issues Encountered
1. Missing `ContractTemplateFactory` - factory doesn't exist
2. Quote model missing `total` column
3. Contract model missing constants (RENEWAL_MANUAL)
4. Service requires clauses configured on templates
5. Complex dependencies on other services (PdfService, DigitalSignatureService, ClauseService)

### Recommendation
ContractGenerationService requires:
1. Factory classes to be created first
2. Database schema updates
3. Missing constants to be defined
4. Integration/feature tests rather than unit tests due to heavy dependencies

## Files Created

### Test Files
1. `/opt/nestogy/tests/Unit/Services/NavigationServiceTest.php` - 102 test methods
2. `/opt/nestogy/tests/Unit/Services/ContractGenerationServiceTest.php` - 17 test methods

### Documentation
1. `/opt/nestogy/storage/FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md`
2. `/opt/nestogy/storage/FINAL_COVERAGE.txt`
3. `/opt/nestogy/storage/navigation-service-coverage.txt`
4. `/opt/nestogy/storage/TEST_SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Single Test File Approach**: One comprehensive test file per service
2. **100% Public Method Coverage Goal**: Focus on public API testing
3. **Feature-level Testing**: Protected methods tested through public methods
4. **Organized Test Structure**: Clear sections with comments
5. **Edge Cases**: Testing error conditions and validation
6. **Integration Tests**: Testing workflows and method interactions
7. **Proper Setup/Teardown**: Clean state management
8. **Factory Usage**: Leveraging Laravel factories for test data

## Lessons Learned

1. Services with heavy dependencies need integration tests
2. Missing factories block unit testing
3. Database schema must match factory expectations  
4. Constants and enums must be defined in models
5. Feature tests may be more appropriate for complex services

## Next Steps

For future testing sessions:
1. Ensure all factories exist before writing tests
2. Verify database schema matches expectations
3. Check for required constants/enums in models
4. Consider integration tests for services with many dependencies
5. Start with simpler services before complex ones
