# Comprehensive Testing Suite for Invoice and Quote Controllers

This document outlines the comprehensive testing suite created for the Invoice and Quote management controllers in the Nestogy application.

## Overview

A comprehensive test suite has been created covering the following controllers:

### Controllers Tested

1. **InvoiceController** (`App\Domains\Financial\Controllers\InvoiceController`)
   - **File**: `tests/Feature/Financial/InvoiceControllerTest.php`
   - **Test Count**: 43 test methods
   - **Coverage**: CRUD operations, item management, payments, status updates, PDF/email, duplication, deletion, CSV export, notes, contract linking

2. **QuoteController** (`App\Domains\Financial\Controllers\QuoteController`)
   - **File**: `tests/Feature/Financial/QuoteControllerTest.php`
   - **Test Count**: 61 test methods
   - **Coverage**: CRUD operations, approval workflow, item management, conversions (invoice/recurring/contract), duplication, revisions, templates, AJAX endpoints, bulk operations, statistics

3. **InvoicesController (API)** (`App\Domains\Financial\Controllers\Api\InvoicesController`)
   - **File**: `tests/Feature/Financial/Api/InvoicesControllerTest.php`
   - **Test Count**: 37 test methods
   - **Coverage**: REST API endpoints, JSON responses, filtering, pagination, calculations, recurring features, payment retry

4. **Portal InvoiceController** (`App\Domains\Client\Controllers\Api\Portal\InvoiceController`)
   - **File**: `tests/Feature/Portal/InvoiceControllerTest.php`
   - **Test Count**: 21 test methods
   - **Coverage**: Client portal access, rate limiting, activity logging, dashboard stats, PDF access, payment options

5. **Client QuoteController** (Optional)
   - **File**: `tests/Feature/Client/QuoteControllerTest.php`
   - **Test Count**: To be implemented
   - **Coverage**: Simplified quote management for clients

**Total Test Methods**: 162+ (with additional edge cases and integration tests)

## Test Categories

### 1. Index/Listing Tests
- View rendering for authenticated users
- JSON response formatting with proper structure
- Filtering by status, date range, client, search terms
- Pagination with per_page parameter
- Summary/statistics inclusion
- Company data isolation

**Example**:
```php
public function test_index_returns_livewire_view(): void
{
    $response = $this->get(route('financial.invoices.index'));
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    $response->assertViewIs('financial.invoices.index-livewire');
}
```

### 2. Create/Store Tests
- Form rendering with required data
- Successful creation with redirect/JSON response
- Validation of required fields
- Validation of related entities (client, category)
- Proper relationships and company assignment

**Example**:
```php
public function test_store_creates_invoice_successfully(): void
{
    $data = [
        'client_id' => $this->client->id,
        'category_id' => $this->category->id,
        'date' => now()->format('Y-m-d'),
        'due_date' => now()->addDays(30)->format('Y-m-d'),
        'amount' => 1500,
        'status' => 'Draft',
        'currency_code' => 'USD',
    ];

    $response = $this->post(route('financial.invoices.store'), $data);
    $response->assertRedirect();
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('invoices', ['client_id' => $this->client->id]);
}
```

### 3. Show/View Tests
- Display with proper relationships loaded
- JSON response with required fields
- Authorization checks
- Totals/calculations display
- Denying access to unauthorized resources

### 4. Edit/Update Tests
- Form rendering with pre-filled data
- Successful updates with redirects
- Status-based edit restrictions (e.g., draft-only)
- Validation on update
- Company isolation enforcement

### 5. Item Management Tests
- Adding items with validation
- Updating items with calculations
- Deleting items
- Quantity and price validation
- Relationship integrity

### 6. Workflow Tests
- Status transitions (Draft → Sent → Paid → Cancelled)
- Approval workflows (submit, process, approve, reject)
- Email sending with template rendering
- PDF generation and download
- Duplication and copying

### 7. Integration Tests
- Authorization and permissions
- Company data isolation
- User authentication requirements
- Rate limiting (portal endpoints)
- Activity logging

### 8. Edge Cases
- Zero amounts and boundary conditions
- Overdue calculations
- Multiple currencies
- Large datasets with pagination
- Empty relationships

### 9. API-Specific Tests
- JSON request/response handling
- Metric calculations (total_paid, balance_due, is_overdue)
- Filtering and search functionality
- Error responses with validation errors

## Test Setup & Configuration

### Common Setup Methods

All tests inherit from `Tests\TestCase` and use `RefreshDatabase` trait:

```php
protected User $user;
protected Company $company;
protected Client $client;
protected Category $category;

protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();
    
    $this->company = Company::factory()->create();
    $this->user = User::factory()->create(['company_id' => $this->company->id]);
    $this->client = Client::factory()->create(['company_id' => $this->company->id]);
    
    // Set up Bouncer permissions
    \Silber\Bouncer\BouncerFacade::scope()->to($this->company->id);
    \Silber\Bouncer\BouncerFacade::allow($this->user)->everything();
    
    $this->actingAs($this->user);
}
```

### Authentication

Portal tests use a helper method for client authentication:
```php
protected function actingAsPortalClient(Client $client)
{
    return $this->withHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' . 'portal_token_' . $client->id);
}
```

## Data Factories

The existing factories are used:
- `InvoiceFactory` with states: `draft()`, `sent()`, `viewed()`, `paid()`, `overdue()`, `cancelled()`
- `QuoteFactory` with various statuses and approval levels
- `ClientFactory`, `CompanyFactory`, `UserFactory`

Custom factory methods are available:
- `->forClient($client)` - Associate with specific client
- `->forCompany($company)` - Associate with specific company
- `->withTotal($amount)` - Set specific total
- `->recent()` - Create within last 30 days
- `->withDiscount($amount)` - Add discount

## Service Mocking

Services are mocked to isolate controller testing:

```php
// Mock EmailService
$this->mock(EmailServiceInterface::class, function ($mock) {
    $mock->shouldReceive('sendInvoiceEmail')->andReturn(true);
});

// Mock PdfService
$this->mock(PdfServiceInterface::class, function ($mock) {
    $mock->shouldReceive('generateFilename')->andReturn('invoice-001.pdf');
    $mock->shouldReceive('download')->andReturn(response('pdf content'));
});
```

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Financial/
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Financial/InvoiceControllerTest.php
```

### Run Tests Without Coverage
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Financial/ --no-coverage
```

### Run With Verbose Output
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Financial/ -v
```

### Run and Stop on First Failure
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Financial/ --stop-on-failure
```

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Checking Database State
```php
$this->assertDatabaseHas('invoices', [
    'id' => $invoice->id,
    'status' => 'sent',
]);

$this->assertDatabaseMissing('invoices', ['id' => $invoice->id]);
```

### 2. Checking Session Data
```php
$response->assertSessionHas('success', 'Invoice created successfully');
$response->assertSessionHasErrors(['field_name']);
```

### 3. Checking JSON Responses
```php
$response->assertJsonPath('data.id', $invoice->id);
$response->assertJsonStructure(['data' => ['id', 'status', 'amount']]);
$response->assertJson(['success' => true]);
```

### 4. Checking Redirects
```php
$response->assertRedirect(route('financial.invoices.show', $invoice));
$response->assertRedirect();
```

### 5. Checking View Data
```php
$response->assertViewIs('financial.invoices.show-livewire');
$response->assertViewHas('invoice', $invoice);
```

## Known Limitations & TODOs

1. **Portal Route Testing**: Portal routes use implicit parameter binding which needs adjustment
2. **Copy/Duplicate Routes**: Custom copy functionality routes may need route method verification
3. **Payment Application**: Payment application tests need more complete setup
4. **Contract Conversion**: Tests assume contract feature is available
5. **VoIP-Specific Features**: Quote VoIP tax breakdown testing needs full implementation

## Improvements Made

The test suite includes:

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: 160+ test methods covering all major functionality
✅ **Clean Setup**: DRY approach with proper test isolation via `RefreshDatabase`
✅ **Authorization Testing**: Permission checks for multi-company scenarios
✅ **Company Isolation**: Tests verify users cannot access other companies' data
✅ **Mock Services**: External services properly mocked
✅ **JSON & HTML Testing**: Both `wantsJson()` code paths tested
✅ **Factory Usage**: Proper use of existing factories with custom states
✅ **Error Testing**: Validation and error response testing
✅ **Documentation**: Clear test organization with descriptive names

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Route Issues**: Some status filter routes need adjustment
2. **Add Missing Tests**: Client QuoteController tests
3. **Integration Tests**: Test full workflows end-to-end
4. **Performance Tests**: Test with large datasets
5. **Refactoring**: Create shared test traits for common assertions
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up test coverage reporting
