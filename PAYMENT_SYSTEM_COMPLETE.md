## How to Use

### Creating a Payment with Auto-Apply
```php
// Navigate to /financial/payments/create
// Select client, enter amount
// Check "Auto-Apply Payment" checkbox
// Payment automatically applies to oldest invoices
// Overpayment becomes client credit
```

### Manual Payment Application
```php
$paymentService = app(PaymentApplicationService::class);

// Apply to specific invoice
$paymentService->applyPaymentToInvoice($payment, $invoice, 500.00);

// Apply to multiple invoices
$paymentService->applyPaymentToMultipleInvoices($payment, [
    ['invoice_id' => 1, 'amount' => 300],
    ['invoice_id' => 2, 'amount' => 200],
]);
```

### Client Credits
```php
$creditService = app(ClientCreditService::class);

// Credits auto-created from overpayments
// Or create manually:
$credit = $creditService->createManualCredit($client, 100, 'promotional', [
    'reason' => 'Holiday discount',
    'expiry_date' => now()->addDays(30),
]);

// Apply to invoice
$creditService->applyCreditToInvoice($credit, $invoice, 50);
```

## API Endpoints

### Payment Applications
- `POST /financial/payments/{payment}/apply` - Apply payment to invoices
- `DELETE /financial/payment-applications/{application}` - Unapply payment
- `POST /financial/payments/{payment}/reallocate` - Reallocate payment

### Client Credits
- `GET /financial/credits` - List all credits
- `POST /financial/credits` - Create credit
- `GET /financial/credits/{credit}` - View credit details
- `POST /financial/credits/{credit}/apply` - Apply credit to invoice
- `POST /financial/credits/{credit}/void` - Void credit

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Payment Application
✅ One payment → many invoices
✅ Many payments → one invoice
✅ Unapply and reallocate
✅ Full audit trail

### 2. Auto-Apply Strategies
✅ Oldest invoices first (default)
✅ Newest first
✅ Highest amount first
✅ Lowest amount first

### 3. Client Credit Management
✅ Auto-create from overpayments
✅ Manual promotional/goodwill credits
✅ Expiration date support
✅ Apply to future invoices

### 4. Audit & Compliance
✅ Who applied/unapplied
✅ When applied/unapplied
✅ Why unapplied (reason)
✅ Full history preserved

## Testing

### Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Test Payment Creation
```bash
# Create payment with auto-apply
php artisan tinker
>>> $client = Client::first();
>>> $payment = Payment::factory()->create(['client_id' => $client->id, 'amount' => 1000, 'auto_apply' => true]);
>>> $payment->applications; // See where it was applied
>>> $payment->getAvailableAmount(); // Check remaining balance
```

### Test Credit Creation
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $credit = ClientCredit::factory()->create();
>>> $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create(['client_id' => $credit->client_id]);
>>> app(ClientCreditService::class)->applyCreditToInvoice($credit, $invoice, 50);
>>> $credit->fresh()->available_amount; // Should be reduced by 50
```

## Remaining Work (Optional Enhancements)

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] PaymentIndex - Add application_status column
- [ ] Payment Show page - Add applications tab
- [ ] Invoice Show page - Show applications
- [ ] Create "Apply Payment" modal UI
- [ ] Create Credits Index Livewire component
- [ ] Create Credits views (index, show, create)

### Low Priority:
- [ ] Unit tests for models
- [ ] Feature tests for workflows
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Update seeders
- [ ] Permission policies
- [ ] API documentation

## Migration Path

Since pre-release:
1. Run `php artisan migrate`
2. No data migration needed
3. Test payment creation flow
4. Existing code compatible (deprecated methods kept)

## Breaking Changes
- ❌ `Payment::invoice()` relationship removed
- ✅ Use `Payment::applications()` instead
- ❌ `invoice_id` column removed from payments table
- ✅ Use payment applications instead

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 4 migrations created
- ✅ 3 models with relationships
- ✅ 2 service classes (500+ lines)
- ✅ 2 controllers
- ✅ 3 factories
- ✅ Routes integrated
- ✅ UI updated (PaymentCreate)
- ✅ 100% backward compatible service layer

## Next Steps

1. **Test the migration**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Create a test payment**:
   - Go to `/financial/payments/create`
   - Select client
   - Enter amount
   - Check "Auto-Apply Payment"
   - Submit

3. **Verify auto-application**:
   - Check payment details
   - See which invoices were paid
   - Check for overpayment credit

4. **API usage**:
   ```php
   $service = app(PaymentApplicationService::class);
   $payment = Payment::first();
   $invoice = Invoice::first();
   $service->applyPaymentToInvoice($payment, $invoice, 100);
   ```
