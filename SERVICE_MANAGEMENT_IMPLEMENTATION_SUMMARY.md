# Service Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **business service management system** for Nestogy that transforms how you manage client services. This is NOT about Laravel service classes - this is about managing the actual IT/managed services you sell to clients.

## 🎯 Core Components Implemented

### 1. **ClientServiceManagementService** ✅
**Location:** `/app/Domains/Client/Services/ClientServiceManagementService.php`

The main orchestrator for service lifecycle management:
- ✅ Provision new services from product templates
- ✅ Activate services (triggers recurring billing)
- ✅ Suspend services (pauses billing)
- ✅ Cancel services (with automatic fee calculation)
- ✅ Renew services
- ✅ Calculate MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- ✅ Track service health scores
- ✅ Transfer services between clients

### 2. **ServiceProvisioningService** ✅
**Location:** `/app/Domains/Client/Services/ServiceProvisioningService.php`

Manages multi-step service setup:
- ✅ Initiate provisioning workflow
- ✅ Assign technicians (primary + backup)
- ✅ Setup monitoring
- ✅ Configure SLA parameters
- ✅ Track provisioning progress
- ✅ Complete/fail provisioning

### 3. **ServiceBillingService** ✅
**Location:** `/app/Domains/Client/Services/ServiceBillingService.php`

Financial integration and automation:
- ✅ Auto-create recurring billing when service activated
- ✅ Generate service invoices for periods
- ✅ Calculate proration for partial billing periods
- ✅ Apply setup fees
- ✅ Calculate cancellation fees (50% of remaining contract)
- ✅ Suspend/resume billing
- ✅ Revenue projections

### 4. **ServiceRenewalService** ✅
**Location:** `/app/Domains/Client/Services/ServiceRenewalService.php`

Automated renewal management:
- ✅ Process auto-renewals (scheduled job ready)
- ✅ Check renewal eligibility
- ✅ Calculate renewal pricing
- ✅ Send renewal notifications (30/14/7 days)
- ✅ Create renewal quotes
- ✅ Approve/deny renewals
- ✅ Grace period management

### 5. **ServiceMonitoringService** ✅
**Location:** `/app/Domains/Client/Services/ServiceMonitoringService.php`

Health tracking and SLA compliance:
- ✅ Check SLA compliance
- ✅ Track uptime metrics
- ✅ Calculate health scores (0-100)
- ✅ Record SLA breaches/incidents
- ✅ Generate service alerts
- ✅ Create SLA reports
- ✅ Batch health checks

## 📊 Database Enhancements

### New Fields Added to `client_services` Table:

**Relationships:**
- `contract_id` - Link to contracts
- `product_id` - Link to service templates
- `recurring_billing_id` - Link to recurring billing

**Lifecycle Tracking:**
- `provisioning_status` - Workflow status
- `provisioned_at` - When provisioned
- `activated_at` - When activated
- `suspended_at` - When suspended
- `cancelled_at` - When cancelled

**Cancellation:**
- `cancellation_reason` - Why cancelled
- `cancellation_fee` - Calculated penalty

**Renewal:**
- `renewal_date` - When renewal due
- `renewal_count` - Times renewed
- `last_renewed_at` - Last renewal date

**Health & SLA:**
- `health_score` - 0-100 health rating
- `last_health_check_at` - Last check time
- `sla_breaches_count` - Breach counter
- `last_sla_breach_at` - Most recent breach

**Financial:**
- `actual_monthly_revenue` - Revenue tracking

**Plus indexes for performance!**

## 🚀 Key Features

### Automated Billing Integration
When you activate a service, it automatically creates a recurring billing record that will generate invoices monthly:

```php
$serviceManager->activateService($service);
// ↓ Automatically creates recurring billing
// ↓ Invoices will be generated automatically
```

### Smart Cancellation Fees
Cancelling early? Automatic calculation of 50% remaining contract value:

```php
$fee = $serviceManager->cancelService($service, now()->addDays(30));
// Returns: $15,000 (if $30k remaining on contract)
```

### Health Scoring
Automatic calculation of service health based on:
- SLA breaches (-5 points each)
- Client satisfaction (±20 points)
- Review overdue status (-20 points)
- Uptime percentage (-25 points max)

### MRR Tracking
Instant calculation of Monthly Recurring Revenue:

```php
$companyMRR = $serviceManager->calculateMRR(); // All active services
$clientMRR = $serviceManager->calculateMRR($client); // Per client
```

### Auto-Renewals
Set it and forget it - services auto-renew when configured:

```php
// Run daily via cron
$results = $renewalService->processAutoRenewals();
// Automatically renews eligible services
```

## 📅 Recommended Scheduled Jobs

Add to `/app/Console/Kernel.php`:

```php
// Process auto-renewals daily at 2 AM
$schedule->call(function () {
    app(ServiceRenewalService::class)->processAutoRenewals();
})->dailyAt('02:00');

// Send renewal reminders daily at 9 AM  
$schedule->call(function () {
    app(ServiceRenewalService::class)->sendRenewalReminders();
})->dailyAt('09:00');

// Run health checks every 6 hours
$schedule->call(function () {
    app(ServiceMonitoringService::class)->runHealthChecks();
})->everySixHours();
```

## 💡 Usage Example - Complete Workflow

```php
// 1. Provision service for new client
$service = $serviceManager->provisionService($client, $managedServicesProduct, [
    'name' => 'Premium Managed IT',
    'monthly_cost' => 3500,
    'setup_cost' => 1000,
    'billing_cycle' => 'monthly',
    'auto_renewal' => true,
    'end_date' => now()->addYear(),
]);

// 2. Setup provisioning
$provisioning->assignTechnicians($service, $seniorTech, $juniorTech);
$provisioning->configureServiceParameters($service, [
    'sla_terms' => '24/7, 1hr response, 4hr resolution',
    'response_time' => '1 hour',
]);
$provisioning->setupMonitoring($service);
$provisioning->completeProvisioning($service);

// 3. Activate (creates recurring billing automatically!)
$serviceManager->activateService($service);

// 4. Service runs, health is monitored
$health = $serviceManager->getServiceHealth($service);
// Returns: ['score' => 95, 'status' => 'healthy', 'factors' => [...]]

// 5. Renewal time comes (auto-processed by cron)
// Or manual renewal:
$renewed = $serviceManager->renewService($service, 12);

// 6. Calculate your MRR
$mrr = $serviceManager->calculateMRR(); // $125,000/month
```

- ✅ `ServiceSuspended` - When service is paused
- ✅ `ServiceResumed` - When service is reactivated
- ✅ `ServiceCancelled` - When service is terminated

- ✅ `ServiceDueForRenewal` - When renewal date approaches (30/14/7 days)
- ✅ `ServiceSLABreached` - When SLA is violated
- ✅ `ServiceHealthDegraded` - When health score drops >10 points

### Listeners Created:
- ✅ `CreateRecurringBillingForService` - Auto-creates billing on activation
- ✅ `SuspendRecurringBilling` - Pauses billing on suspension
- ✅ `ResumeRecurringBilling` - Resumes billing on service resume
- ✅ `NotifyServiceActivated` - Sends activation notifications
- ✅ `NotifyServiceSuspended` - Sends suspension notifications
- ✅ `NotifyServiceRenewalDue` - Sends renewal reminders
- ✅ `AlertOnSLABreach` - Creates tickets/alerts on SLA breach
- ✅ `RecalculateServiceHealth` - Updates health score after breach

### Service Updates:
- ✅ `ClientServiceManagementService` - Dispatches events for all lifecycle operations
- ✅ `ServiceMonitoringService` - Dispatches SLA breach and health degradation events
- ✅ `ServiceRenewalService` - Dispatches renewal due events
- ✅ `AppServiceProvider` - All events registered and mapped to listeners

### Benefits:
- 🔄 **Decoupled Architecture** - Services no longer directly call each other
- 🔔 **Reactive System** - Automatic notifications and actions on state changes
- 📧 **Notification Ready** - All key events trigger appropriate notifications
- 🎯 **Extensible** - Easy to add new listeners without modifying services
- ⚡ **Queued Processing** - All listeners use ShouldQueue for async execution

## ✅ Phase 3A: Notification System (COMPLETED)

### Notifications Created:
- ✅ `ServiceActivatedNotification` - Beautiful HTML email + PWA notification on activation
- ✅ `ServiceSuspendedNotification` - Alerts when service is paused
- ✅ `ServiceRenewalDueNotification` - Reminders at 30/14/7 days before renewal
- ✅ `ServiceSLABreachedNotification` - Urgent alerts for SLA violations
- ✅ `ServiceHealthDegradedNotification` - Warnings when health drops >10 points

### Notification Features:
- 📧 **Beautiful HTML Emails** - Professional Laravel MailMessage format
- 📱 **PWA Notifications** - In-app alerts with icons, colors, and direct links
- ⚡ **Queued Processing** - All notifications sent asynchronously
- 🎯 **Smart Routing** - Notifies technicians, backup techs, and admins as appropriate
- 🔗 **Action Links** - Direct "View Service" buttons to relevant pages

### Updated Listeners:
- ✅ `NotifyServiceActivated` - Now sends actual notifications instead of logging
