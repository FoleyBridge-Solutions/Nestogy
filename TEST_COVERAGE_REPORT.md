## Current Strengths

‚úÖ **Excellent model test infrastructure** (ModelTestCase, factories)  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Client model coverage** (75% methods)  
‚úÖ **Good Livewire component testing patterns** (ClientSwitcher)  
‚úÖ **Strong assertion quality** (testing behavior, not just existence)  
‚úÖ **Proper isolation** (RefreshDatabase, independent tests)

## Current Weaknesses

‚ùå **Limited breadth** (12 of 100+ testable classes covered)  
‚ùå **Service dependencies not mocked** (TaxEngine, RMM, etc.)  
‚ùå **No controller/HTTP tests**  
‚ùå **No integration tests**  
‚ùå **Test pollution issues** (RefreshDatabase clearing routes)

## Conclusion

**We have a SOLID foundation** with 237 passing tests and excellent patterns established. The Client model tests are production-quality. With focused effort on the quick wins above, we can reach 280+ passing tests (83%) within days.

**Realistic 3-month goal**: 50% overall code coverage across all critical paths.
