Test Configuration Issues\n- **Missing Test Directory**: PHPUnit is trying to find a directory at `./tests/Unit/Models/ContractTest.php` but treating it as a directory instead of a file\n- **Incorrect Test Suite Configuration**: The Contract test suite configuration is malformed\n\n### 3. PHPUnit Deprecation Warnings\n- **Metadata in Doc-Comments**: Hundreds of test methods are using deprecated doc-comment metadata instead of PHP attributes\n- **PHPUnit 12 Compatibility**: All test metadata needs to be converted to PHP attributes\n\n### 4.

Update Test Metadata (PHPUnit 12 Compatibility)\n- Convert doc-comment metadata to PHP attributes in all test files:\n  - Replace `@test` with `#[Test]` attribute\n  - Replace `@group` with `#[Group]` attribute\n  - Update all affected test files systematically\n\n### 3. Verify Test Structure\n- Ensure all referenced test files exist\n- Fix test suite configurations to properly reference test files vs directories\n\n### 4.
