## Coverage Projection

Based on current progress:
- **Phase 1 (Complete)**: ~0.70% overall coverage
- **Phase 2 Target**: ~15-20% overall coverage
- **Phase 3 Target**: ~30-35% overall coverage
- **Phase 4 Target**: ~42-47% overall coverage
- **Phase 5 Target**: ~50-55% overall coverage ✅

## Commands for Development

```bash
# Run all passing Phase 1 tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php \
    tests/Unit/Models/CompanyTest.php \
    tests/Unit/Models/ClientTest.php \
    tests/Unit/Models/InvoiceTest.php \
    tests/Unit/Models/PaymentTest.php

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Models/ --coverage-text

# Run specific model test
php artisan test tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php

# Run with minimum coverage requirement
php artisan test --coverage --min=50
```

## Notes

- All Phase 1 models use BelongsToCompany pattern
- Soft deletes implemented via `archived_at` column
- Factory states provide flexibility for different scenarios
- ModelTestCase provides shared fixtures to reduce duplication
- Tests focus on business logic, not framework functionality
- Coverage is low but foundation is solid for expansion

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Phase 1 Core Models**: 51 tests passing (100% pass rate)
   - User, Company, Client, Invoice, Payment models fully tested
   
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Solid foundation established
   - ModelTestCase base class for shared fixtures
   - RefreshDatabase for isolation
   - Factory patterns established

3. **Phase 2 Progress**: Test files created
   - InvoiceItemTest.php: 19 comprehensive tests (needs TaxEngine mocking)
   - ProductTest.php: Expanded with 17+ new tests
   - ProductFactory: Fixed to comply with database constraints
   - ExpenseTest.php: 7 tests (existing)

### ⚠️ Known Issues & Next Steps

1. **InvoiceItem Tests**: Require TaxEngine service mocking
   - Model boot() method automatically calculates taxes
   - Tests fail due to missing `App\Services\TaxEngine\TaxServiceFactory`
   - **Solution**: Mock tax services or disable boot calculations in tests

2. **Product Tests**: Factory constraint issues resolved
   - Fixed `unit_type` and `billing_model` combinations
   - Changed defaults to 'each' and 'one_time' for valid combinations

3. **Coverage Target**: Original 50% goal requires adjustment
   - Current Phase 1: ~0.70% overall model coverage
   - Realistic target with additional models: 5-10% achievable
   - Complex business logic (tax calculations, VoIP services) harder to test
   
### Recommendations

1. **Short Term** (High Priority):
   - Mock TaxEngine services to enable InvoiceItem tests
   - Complete Product test suite verification
   - Add 2-3 more simple models (Contact, Category, Tag)

2. **Medium Term** (Medium Priority):
   - Implement Quote, CreditNote, RecurringInvoice tests
   - Add Ticket, Project, TimeEntry tests
   - Reach 10-15% model coverage

3. **Long Term** (Low Priority):
   - Complete all 30 planned models
   - Target 30-40% realistic coverage (vs original 50%+ plan)
   - Focus on business-critical paths rather than exhaustive coverage

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 Complete**: 51 tests passing with excellent infrastructure foundation.

**Phase 2 Partial**: Test files created for InvoiceItem (19 tests), Product (25+ tests), Expense (7 tests). Some tests require service mocking to pass.

**Updated Realistic Goal**: 10-15% model coverage achievable with focused effort on high-value models, versus the original aggressive 50%+ target which requires mocking complex business services throughout the application.
