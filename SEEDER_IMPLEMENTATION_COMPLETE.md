## Next Steps

### To Run Seeding
```bash
# Fresh migration + seed
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Or just seed (if database exists)
php artisan db:seed --class=Database\\Seeders\\Dev\\DevDatabaseSeeder
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests against seeded data
php artisan test

# Check specific domain seeding
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Domains\HR\Models\Shift::count()
>>> App\Domains\Tax\Models\Tax::count()
>>> App\Domains\Collections\Models\DunningCampaign::count()
```

### Verification Queries
```php
// Check HR seeding
Shift::count() // Should be ~60 (6 per company × 10 companies)
EmployeeSchedule::count() // Should be ~20,000+
EmployeeTimeEntry::count() // Should be ~10,000+

// Check Tax seeding  
Tax::count() // Should be ~150 (15 per company × 10 companies)
TaxJurisdiction::count() // Should be ~400+
TaxCalculation::count() // Should be ~10,000+

// Check Collections seeding
DunningCampaign::count() // Should be ~40
DunningAction::count() // Should be ~500+

// Check Usage seeding
UsageRecord::count() // Should be ~30,000+
UsageBucket::count() // Should be ~500+

// Check Financial seeding
CreditNote::count() // Should be ~750+
RefundTransaction::count() // Should be ~150+
RevenueMetric::count() // Should be ~340+
```
