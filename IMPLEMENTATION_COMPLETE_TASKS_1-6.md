## Known Limitations / Future Enhancements

### Rate Card Management
- ⚠️ No UI for creating/editing rate cards (can be done via Tinker/Seeder)
- 💡 Suggestion: Build RateCardManagement Livewire component

### Billing Approval
- ⚠️ No email notifications when invoice generated
- 💡 Suggestion: Add Task 3.1 email notifications

### Satisfaction Surveys
- ⚠️ Survey link in reminder email uses placeholder route name
- 💡 Need to ensure portal route naming matches

### SLA Portal Display
- ⚠️ Backend complete, but no portal UI integration yet
- 💡 Suggestion: Add SLA info to portal ticket show page

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:

### Database Seeding (Optional)
To create sample rate cards:
```php
use App\Domains\Financial\Models\RateCard;
use App\Models\Client;

$client = Client::first();

RateCard::create([
    'company_id' => $client->company_id,
    'client_id' => $client->id,
    'name' => 'Standard Hourly Rate',
    'service_type' => 'standard',
    'hourly_rate' => 125.00,
    'effective_from' => now(),
    'is_default' => true,
    'is_active' => true,
    'rounding_increment' => 15,
    'rounding_method' => 'up',
]);
