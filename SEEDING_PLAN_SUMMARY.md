   - No tax exemptions or API integration
   - **Impact:** Cannot test tax compliance

3. **Collections (4 missing)**
   - No dunning campaigns or sequences

   - **Impact:** Cannot test collections workflow

4. **Product/Usage (7 missing)**
   - No services, usage pools, buckets, tiers
   - No usage-based billing
   - **Impact:** Cannot test SaaS billing features

5. **HR (4 completely missing files)**
   - No shift seeder

## Next Steps

1. **Review the diagrams**
   - Open MODEL_DEPENDENCY_FLOWCHART.md in GitHub or Mermaid Live Editor
   - Understand the relationships

2. **Start implementation**
   - Begin with Phase 1 (Critical Missing Seeders)
   - Work level by level, respecting dependencies

3. **Test continuously**
   - Test each level independently
   - Verify FK constraints don't break
