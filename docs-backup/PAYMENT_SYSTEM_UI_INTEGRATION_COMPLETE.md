## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Q: Payment applications not showing?**
A: Check that payment has `application_status` calculated. Run `$payment->recalculateApplicationAmounts()`.

**Q: Invoice balance incorrect?**
A: Ensure invoice is using `getBalance()` method, not raw `getTotalPaid()`.

**Q: Credit not appearing in list?**
A: Check credit status is 'active' and not expired/voided.

**Q: Unapply button not working?**
A: Verify route `financial.payment-applications.destroy` exists and CSRF token is present.

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check payment applications
php artisan tinker
>>> $payment = Payment::first();
>>> $payment->applications;
>>> $payment->getAvailableAmount();
>>> $payment->recalculateApplicationAmounts();

# Check credit applications
>>> $credit = ClientCredit::first();
>>> $credit->applications;
>>> $credit->available_amount;

# Check invoice applications
>>> $invoice = Invoice::first();
>>> $invoice->paymentApplications;
>>> $invoice->creditApplications;
>>> $invoice->getBalance();
```
