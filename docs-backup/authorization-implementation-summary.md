# Nestogy ERP Authorization System - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive authorization and permissions system implementation for Nestogy ERP, a Laravel-based enterprise resource planning application. The implementation provides enterprise-grade role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions across all business domains.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Database Schema
- **Permissions Table**: Core permissions with domain.action structure
- **Roles Table**: Hierarchical role system with levels (Accountant=1, Tech=2, Admin=3)
- **Permission Groups Table**: Organizational grouping for related permissions
- **Role Permissions Table**: Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions
- **User Roles Table**: User role assignments with company scoping
- **User Permissions Table**: Individual permission overrides for users

#### 2. Models and Traits
- **Permission Model** (`app/Models/Permission.php`): Core permission management
- **Role Model** (`app/Models/Role.php`): Role hierarchy and relationships
- **HasPermissions Trait** (`app/Traits/HasPermissions.php`): User permission functionality
- **HasAuthorization Trait** (`app/Traits/HasAuthorization.php`): Controller authorization patterns
- **HasExportControls Trait** (`app/Traits/HasExportControls.php`): Export security
- **HasApprovalWorkflows Trait** (`app/Traits/HasApprovalWorkflows.php`): Financial approval workflows

#### 3. Authorization Layers
- **Route Middleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/PermissionMiddleware.php`): Route-level protection
- **Policy Classes**: Model-specific authorization logic for all domains
- **Gate Definitions**: Complex business logic authorization
- **Controller Checks**: Additional security at the controller level
