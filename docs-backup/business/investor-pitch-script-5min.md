# Nestogy Investor Pitch - 5 Minute Voiceover Script
## ~750 words for 5-minute voiceover

[exhausted] Another MSP just flatlined. [pause] Thirty-year-old company. Two hundred clients. Gone. [bitter] Not because they couldn't fix servers, but because they couldn't fix their business.

[sardonic] They had ConnectWise. [disgusted] Twenty thousand dollar setup. Six months of training. [incredulous] Still took four screens just to create one invoice. [frustrated] Their techs spent more time navigating software than solving problems.

[leaning in, conspiratorial] Here's what nobody talks about. [building] The MSP industry is three hundred billion dollars, growing twenty percent yearly. [confused] Yet seventy percent of MSPs operate at under fifteen percent margins. [demanding] Why?

[exasperated] Tool sprawl. [counting off] PSA here. RMM there. Documentation somewhere else. Billing in QuickBooks. Contracts in DocuSign. Passwords in another vault. [overwhelmed] Seven browser tabs minimum. [resigned] Always.

[scoffing] Meanwhile, SuperOps raised forty million selling AI that writes nice ticket responses [angry] while you still manually reconcile payments. [dismissive] HaloPSA? Built for five-hundred-seat enterprises, [sympathetic] not the forty thousand MSPs with ten techs trying to scale.

[shocked] ConnectWise still passes client IDs in URLs. [disbelief] In 2025. [mocking] That's like leaving your house keys under the doormat [theatrical] with a neon sign.

[shift, confident] We built Nestogy because we lived this nightmare. [serious] Not theoretically. Actually. [passionate] Years running MSPs, watching great technicians burn out on bad software.

[intrigued, teaching] Let me tell you what we discovered. [impressed] One hundred seventy-six database migrations. [emphatic] Not random tables. [building pride] Five years of MSP workflow refinement. Every edge case. [knowing] Every late-night discovery that this industry needs something different.

[technical, excited] Our session-based architecture means twenty techs can work simultaneously on different clients [amazed] without a single conflict or page reload. [proud] No URL parameters. [definitive] None.

[calculating, analytical] ConnectWise users lose forty-seven seconds per client switch. [repeating for emphasis] Forty-seven seconds. [multiplying] Times fifty switches daily. [shocked at result] That's forty hours monthly per tech. [disgusted] Gone.

[mysterious] But here's where it gets interesting. [anticipation building]

[demonstrating, energetic] Technician opens a ticket. [rapid-fire] The system already knows everything. Which contract covers this client. What the billing rate is. [impressed] That it's currently after-hours, [automatic] so emergency rates apply. [satisfied] The timer starts automatically.

[flowing] Work gets done. Timer stops. [building momentum] Now watch. [rapid delivery] Time entry becomes invoice line. Invoice calculates taxes. Payment processes through Stripe, Square, or ACH. Books reconcile. Client gets notified.

[triumphant pause] Zero. [emphatic] Manual. [final] Steps.

[serious, data-driven] Our ProcessRecurringBilling command handles ten thousand invoices [impressed with own product] in thirty minutes. [defensive] Not marketing speak. [proud] Actual performance metrics from production.

[technical pride] Seventeen background job processors running constantly. [listing rapidly] AnalyzeTicketSentiment for automatic prioritization. AutoAssignTicket routing based on technician skills. [connecting] SyncRmmAgents pulling from ConnectWise Automate, Datto, NinjaOne [amazed] simultaneously.

[strategic, competitive] But here's what competitors literally cannot copy. [teaching] Fifteen independent business domains using Domain-Driven Design. [mind-blown] Each domain can run standalone. [entrepreneurial] You could white-label just our contract management [calculating] and sell it as a separate product.

[fascinated, geeking out] Speaking of contracts - [pause for effect] ours are programmable. [listing features] Dynamic pricing based on usage, time, or events. [impressed] Auto-escalation clauses that actually enforce themselves. [satisfied] SLA penalties that calculate and apply automatically.

[precise, technical] The TimeTrackingService doesn't just track time. [building] It detects rate types. [listing] Standard, after-hours, emergency, weekend, holiday. [automatic] Automatically applies the right rate. [seamless] Converts to invoice lines with proper tax categorization.

[shifting to personal, quieter] You know what our beta users tell us? [quoting] First month, they recovered thirty percent of previously lost billable time. [reality check] That's not efficiency. [emphatic] That's revenue. [passionate] Real money that was always there, [frustrated] just leaking through the cracks.

[storytelling, amazed] Another client automated their entire contract renewal process. [impressive] Sixty contracts renewed without a single human touch. [money voice] Forty-two thousand in recurring revenue secured [casual] while the owner was on vacation.

[strategic, investor-focused] The market opportunity is staggering. [data] Forty thousand MSPs globally. [calculating] Our average contract value is six thousand monthly. [building to reveal] Just two percent market share [pause] is nearly half a billion in ARR.

[grounded, honest] We're not starting from zero. [factual] Platform's built. Running in production. [real] Processing real invoices. Real payments. [emphatic] Real businesses depending on us daily.

[competitive fire] While ConnectWise trains private equity owners on their twentieth acquisition, [dismissive] while SuperOps burns through funding on ChatGPT wrappers, [frustrated] while HaloPSA ignores the SMB market - [determined] we're capturing the MSPs that everyone else forgot.

[direct, closing the deal] We're raising Series A. [clarifying] Not to figure out product-market fit. [aggressive] To pour fuel on a fire that's already burning. [listing] Sales team. Market expansion. [considering] Maybe an acquisition or two of complementary tools.

[visionary, building to climax] The MSP industry is about to consolidate. [prophetic] The broken tools will die. [strategic] The complex ones will serve enterprises. [confident] And Nestogy will power everyone else.

[final push, determined] Join us. [passionate] Fix this broken industry. [rallying cry] Build the platform forty thousand MSPs actually need.

[warm, inviting] Let's talk.
