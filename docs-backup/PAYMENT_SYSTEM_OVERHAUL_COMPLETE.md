# Payment System Overhaul - Implementation Summary

## Status: CORE COMPLETE âœ…

The payment system has been successfully overhauled to support flexible payment applications, separating payments from their application to invoices. This allows for much more powerful and flexible payment management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema âœ…

#### New Tables Created:
1. **`payment_applications`** - Tracks applications of payments to invoices/entities
   - Polymorphic relationship to any applicable entity (invoices, payment plans, etc.)
   - Tracks active/inactive state for unapplication support
   - Audit trail with applied_by/unapplied_by user tracking

2. **`client_credits`** - Manages client credits from various sources
   - Multiple credit types: overpayment, prepayment, credit_note, promotional, goodwill, etc.
   - Lifecycle management: active, depleted, expired, voided
   - Expiration date support
   - Auto-generated reference numbers

3. **`client_credit_applications`** - Tracks usage of client credits
   - Similar structure to payment_applications
   - Polymorphic to support applying to invoices/other entities
   - Unapplication support

#### Modified Tables:
1. **`payments`** table updated:
   - REMOVED: `invoice_id` foreign key column
   - ADDED: `applied_amount`, `available_amount`, `application_status`, `auto_apply`
   - Payment now tracks how much is applied vs available

### 2. Models Created/Updated âœ…

#### New Models:
1. **`PaymentApplication`** (`app/Models/PaymentApplication.php`)
   - Relationships: payment(), applicable() (morphTo), appliedBy(), unappliedBy()
   - Methods: isActive(), unapply(), reapply()
   - Auto-updates payment and invoice on create/delete

2. **`ClientCredit`** (`app/Models/ClientCredit.php`)
   - Relationships: client(), source() (morphTo), applications(), activeApplications()
   - Methods: getAvailableAmount(), isExpired(), isDepleted(), isActive(), canApply(), markAsDepleted(), void(), recalculateAvailableAmount()
   - Auto-generates reference numbers (CR-2025-000001 format)

3. **`ClientCreditApplication`** (`app/Models/ClientCreditApplication.php`)
   - Relationships: clientCredit(), applicable() (morphTo), appliedBy(), unappliedBy()
   - Methods: isActive(), unapply(), reapply()

#### Updated Models:
1. **`Payment`** (`app/Models/Payment.php`)
   - REMOVED: invoice() relationship
   - ADDED: applications(), activeApplications(), appliedInvoices()
   - ADDED: getAvailableAmount(), isFullyApplied(), isPartiallyApplied(), isUnapplied(), canApply(), recalculateApplicationAmounts()
   - Auto-initializes available_amount on creation

2. **`Invoice`** (`app/Models/Invoice.php`)
   - ADDED: paymentApplications(), activePaymentApplications(), creditApplications(), activeCreditApplications()
   - UPDATED: getTotalPaid() - now includes both payment and credit applications
   - ADDED: updatePaymentStatus() - recalculates invoice status based on paid amount
   - KEPT: payments() relationship marked as @deprecated for backward compatibility

### 3. Services Created/Updated âœ…

#### New Services:
1. **`PaymentApplicationService`** (`app/Domains/Financial/Services/PaymentApplicationService.php`)
   - `applyPaymentToInvoice()` - Apply specific amount to single invoice
   - `applyPaymentToMultipleInvoices()` - Distribute payment across invoices
   - `unapplyPayment()` - Remove payment application
   - `reallocatePayment()` - Unapply all and reapply to different invoices
   - `autoApplyPayment()` - Smart auto-application with strategies (oldest_first, newest_first, highest_first, lowest_first)
   - `getAvailableApplicationTargets()` - Get unpaid invoices for client
   - `getPaymentApplicationHistory()` - Full audit trail
   - Supports overpayment â†’ client credit creation

2. **`ClientCreditService`** (`app/Domains/Financial/Services/ClientCreditService.php`)
   - `createCreditFromOverpayment()` - Auto-create credit from excess payment
   - `createCreditFromCreditNote()` - Convert credit note to client credit
   - `createManualCredit()` - Create promotional/goodwill/adjustment credits
   - `applyCreditToInvoice()` - Apply credit to invoice balance
   - `expireCredit()` - Handle credit expiration
   - `voidCredit()` - Void/cancel credit
   - `getClientAvailableCredits()` - Get all active credits for client
   - `getTotalAvailableCredit()` - Sum of available credit
   - `autoExpireCredits()` - Batch expire expired credits (for CRON)

#### Updated Services:
1. **`PaymentService`** (`app/Domains/Financial/Services/PaymentService.php`)
   - UPDATED: `createPayment()` - Now supports auto_apply and uses PaymentApplicationService
   - UPDATED: `updatePayment()` - Simplified (no longer updates invoices directly)
   - REMOVED: `updateInvoicePaymentStatus()` - handled by PaymentApplicationService

2. **`PaymentProcessingService`** (`app/Domains/Financial/Services/PaymentProcessingService.php`)
   - FIXED: `applyPaymentToInvoices()` - replaced raw DB queries with PaymentApplicationService
   - REMOVED: Raw DB inserts to non-existent tables

### 4. Controllers Updated âœ…

1. **`PaymentController`** (`app/Domains/Financial/Controllers/PaymentController.php`)
   - UPDATED: `store()` - Now uses PaymentService, supports auto_apply, invoice_id optional
   - UPDATED: `destroy()` - Properly unapplies payment applications before deletion

### 5. Livewire Components (Ready for Implementation) ðŸ“‹

The following components need to be updated/created for the UI:

#### To Update:
- `app/Livewire/Financial/PaymentCreate.php` - Make invoice optional, add auto_apply toggle
- `app/Livewire/Financial/PaymentIndex.php` - Show application_status column
- Update payment show view - add application history section
- Update invoice show view - show payment/credit applications

#### To Create:
- `app/Livewire/Financial/PaymentApplicationManage.php` - Modal for applying unapplied payments
- `app/Livewire/Financial/ClientCreditIndex.php` - List all client credits
- `app/Livewire/Financial/ClientCreditManage.php` - Create/manage credits
- Controllers: `PaymentApplicationController`, `ClientCreditController`

### 6. Routes (Ready for Implementation) ðŸ“‹

Need to add to `app/Domains/Financial/routes.php`:

```php
// Payment Application Routes
Route::post('payments/{payment}/apply', [PaymentApplicationController::class, 'apply'])->name('payments.apply');
Route::delete('payment-applications/{application}', [PaymentApplicationController::class, 'destroy'])->name('payment-applications.destroy');
Route::post('payments/{payment}/reallocate', [PaymentApplicationController::class, 'reallocate'])->name('payments.reallocate');

// Client Credit Routes
Route::resource('credits', ClientCreditController::class);
Route::post('credits/{credit}/apply', [ClientCreditController::class, 'apply'])->name('credits.apply');
Route::post('credits/{credit}/void', [ClientCreditController::class, 'void'])->name('credits.void');
```

## How It Works Now

### Payment Flow

#### Before (Old System):
```
Payment Created â†’ invoice_id set â†’ Invoice updated
```
- 1 payment = 1 invoice
- Can't change allocation
- Overpayments lost
- No audit trail

#### After (New System):
```
Payment Created â†’ PaymentApplications Created â†’ Invoices Updated
           â†“
    (if overpayment)
           â†“
    ClientCredit Created
```
- 1 payment = MANY invoices
- Can unapply/reallocate
- Overpayments become client credits
- Full audit trail

### Example Usage

```php
use App\Domains\Financial\Services\PaymentApplicationService;

$paymentService = app(PaymentApplicationService::class);

// Create unapplied payment
$payment = Payment::create([
    'client_id' => $client->id,
    'amount' => 1000,
    'status' => 'completed',
    'auto_apply' => false, // Don't auto-apply
]);

// Manually apply to specific invoices
$paymentService->applyPaymentToInvoice($payment, $invoice1, 300);
$paymentService->applyPaymentToInvoice($payment, $invoice2, 500);
// $200 remains unapplied

// OR auto-apply to oldest invoices
$paymentService->autoApplyPayment($payment, ['strategy' => 'oldest_first']);
// Automatically applies to invoices, creates credit if overpayment

// Unapply a payment
$application = $payment->activeApplications->first();
$paymentService->unapplyPayment($application, 'Customer requested reallocation');

// Reallocate entire payment
$paymentService->reallocatePayment($payment, [
    ['invoice_id' => $invoice3->id, 'amount' => 800],
    ['invoice_id' => $invoice4->id, 'amount' => 200],
]);
```

### Client Credits

```php
use App\Domains\Financial\Services\ClientCreditService;

$creditService = app(ClientCreditService::class);

// Create promotional credit
$credit = $creditService->createManualCredit($client, 100, ClientCredit::TYPE_PROMOTIONAL, [
    'reason' => 'Holiday promotion',
    'expiry_date' => now()->addDays(30),
]);

// Apply credit to invoice
$creditService->applyCreditToInvoice($credit, $invoice, 50);

// Get all available credits
$credits = $creditService->getClientAvailableCredits($client);
$totalCredit = $creditService->getTotalAvailableCredit($client);

// Auto-expire old credits (CRON job)
$creditService->autoExpireCredits();
```

## Key Benefits

- Compliance-ready

### 4. Auto-Application
- Smart strategies: oldest first, highest first, etc.
- Configurable per payment
- Handles overpayments automatically

### 5. Extensibility
- Polymorphic relationships support applying to ANY entity
- Easy to add payment plans, subscriptions, etc.
- Service-based architecture for testing
