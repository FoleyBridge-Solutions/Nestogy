## Current Coverage

**Model Coverage: ~0.48% overall**
- User: 1.47% lines, 4.65% methods
- Company: 13.25% lines, 4.17% methods  
- Client: 5.96% lines, 2.08% methods
- Invoice: 1.62% lines
- Setting: 6.16% lines (incidental coverage)

## Infrastructure Setup

### ✅ Completed
1. PostgreSQL test database configured
2. PCOV code coverage driver installed
3. Base test infrastructure:
   - `TestCase` with `CreatesApplication`
   - `ModelTestCase` with common test fixtures (Company, Client, Category)
   - Factory configuration
   - phpunit.xml configured for models coverage

### Test Files Created
- `tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Models/CompanyTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Models/ClientTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Models/InvoiceTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Models/PaymentTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Models/ModelTestCase.php` (base class)

## Issues Fixed
1. Category model - Added `company_id` to fillable attributes
2. Test database configuration - Switched from SQLite to PostgreSQL
3. UserSetting - Added `company_id` requirement to tests
4. Factory dependencies - Created ModelTestCase to manage shared test data

## Remaining Work

### To Fix (9 failing tests)
1. **InvoiceTest** - Missing imports (Company, Client classes)
2. **InvoiceTest** - Database schema mismatch (`sent_at`, `paid_at`, `viewed_at` columns)
3. **PaymentTest** - Factory `processed_by` field creates invalid Users

### Next Steps to Reach 50% Coverage
According to the plan, we need to implement:

**Phase 1 (Continued)** - Core Models:
- Fix Invoice tests
- Fix Payment tests

**Phase 2** - Financial Models (70%+ coverage):
- InvoiceItem
- Product  
- CreditNote
- Quote
- RecurringInvoice
- Expense
- PaymentMethod

**Phase 3** - Operational Models (60%+ coverage):
- Ticket
- Contact
- Project
- TimeEntry
- Asset
- Service

**Phase 4** - Configuration Models (50%+ coverage):
- UserSetting
- CompanyMailSettings
- Setting
- TaxRate
- TaxProfile

**Phase 5** - Supporting Models (40%+ coverage):
- Document
- AuditLog
- Tag
- Category
- Location
- Network
- File

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run all passing tests with coverage
php artisan test tests/Unit/Models/UserTest.php tests/Unit/Models/CompanyTest.php tests/Unit/Models/ClientTest.php --coverage

# Run with minimum coverage requirement
php artisan test --coverage --min=50

# Generate detailed coverage report
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text
```

## Key Metrics
- **Tests Created**: 51 total
- **Tests Passing**: 42 (82%)
- **Tests Failing**: 9 (18%)
- **Assertions**: 73+
- **Test Duration**: ~12-14 seconds
- **Models with Tests**: 5 (User, Company, Client, Invoice, Payment)
- **Models Remaining**: 96

## Notes
- All tests use RefreshDatabase trait for isolation
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Factory states are tested where available
- Relationships are verified through assertions
- Soft deletes are validated
